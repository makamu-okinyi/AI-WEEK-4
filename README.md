Explanation: How AI Improves Test Coverage (150-Word Summary)
AI significantly improves test coverage primarily by addressing the two biggest bottlenecks in traditional testing: brittleness and maintenance.

AI-powered testing platforms (like Testim.io or Selenium with intelligent extensions) use self-healing locators powered by machine learning. Traditional test scripts rely on a single, brittle identifier (like an element's ID). If the developer changes that ID, the test instantly breaks, reducing coverage to zero until a manual fix is made. AI, however, learns multiple attributes of an element (ID, text, visual position, neighbors) and can automatically update the test when the UI changes, maintaining continuous coverage without human intervention.

Furthermore, AI can analyze application usage logs to identify high-risk/high-traffic user paths that lack tests and automatically suggest or generate new test cases for them. This shifts testing from covering known scenarios to intelligently expanding coverage into critical, untested areas, leading to a higher quality and more robust software solution.
